# EXPLANATION

First we have imported all the packages from keras
and later downloaded files using cifar.10.python
which will then divide all into x_train and y_train
since it is a image set each pixel value will rangle between 0 to 255 
now all will be divided by 255 to get some value less than 0 or 1 which will be connected to x_train and x_test
and now according to the given question i have tried to add all the required things fro dropout and compared the accuracy accordingly.
